NAME
    Mojo::Redis2 - Pure-Perl non-blocking I/O Redis driver

VERSION
    0.09

DESCRIPTION
    THIS MODULE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT! FEEDBACK WANTED!

    Mojo::Redis2 is a pure-Perl non-blocking I/O Redis <http://redis.io>
    driver for the Mojolicious real-time framework.

        Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value cache and
        store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys
        can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and
        hyperloglogs. - <http://redis.io>.

    Features:

    *   Blocking support

        Mojo::Redis2 support blocking methods. NOTE: Calling non-blocking
        and blocking methods are supported on the same object, but might
        create a new connection to the server.

    *   Error handling that makes sense

        Mojo::Redis was unable to report back errors that was bound to an
        operation. Mojo::Redis2 on the other hand always make sure each
        callback receive an error message on error.

    *   One object for different operations

        Mojo::Redis had only one connection, so it could not do more than on
        blocking operation on the server side at the time (such as BLPOP,
        SUBSCRIBE, ...). This object creates new connections pr. blocking
        operation which makes it easier to avoid "blocking" bugs.

SYNOPSIS
  Blocking
      use Mojo::Redis2;
      my $redis = Mojo::Redis2->new;

      # Will die() on error.
      $res = $redis->set(foo => "42"); # $res = OK
      $res = $redis->get("foo");       # $res = 42

  Non-blocking
      Mojo::IOLoop->delay(
        sub {
          my ($delay) = @_;
          $redis->ping($delay->begin)->get("foo", $delay->begin);
        },
        sub {
          my ($delay, $ping_err, $ping, $get_err, $get) = @_;
          # On error: $ping_err and $get_err is set to a string
          # On success: $ping = "PONG", $get = "42";
        },
      );

  Pub/sub
    Mojo::Redis2 can "subscribe" and re-use the same object to "publish" or
    run other Redis commands, since it can keep track of multiple
    connections to the same Redis server. It will also re-use the same
    connection when you (p)subscribe multiple times.

      $self->on(message => sub {
        my ($self, $message, $channel) = @_;
      });

      $self->subscribe("some:channel" => sub {
        my ($self, $err) = @_;

        return $self->publish("myapp:errors" => $err) if $err;
        return $self->incr("subscribed:to:some:channel");
      });

  Mojolicious app
      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      helper redis => sub { shift->stash->{redis} ||= Mojo::Redis2->new; };

      get '/' => sub {
        my $c = shift;

        $c->delay(
          sub {
            my ($delay) = @_;
            $c->redis->get('some:message', $delay->begin);
          },
          sub {
            my ($delay, $err, $message) = @_;
            $c->render(json => { error => $err, message => $message });
          },
        );
      };

      app->start;

  Error handling
    $err in this document is a string containing an error message or empty
    string on success.

EVENTS
  connection
      $self->on(error => sub { my ($self, $info) = @_; ... });

    Emitted when a new connection has been established. $info is a hash ref
    with:

      {
        group => $str, # basic, blpop, brpop, brpoplpush, publish, ...
        id => $connection_id,
        nb => $bool, # blocking/non-blocking
      }

    Note: The structure of $info is EXPERIMENTAL.

  error
      $self->on(error => sub { my ($self, $err) = @_; ... });

    Emitted if an error occurs that can't be associated with an operation.

  message
      $self->on(message => sub {
        my ($self, $message, $channel) = @_;
      });

    Emitted when a $message is received on a $channel after it has been
    subscribed to.

  pmessage
      $self->on(pmessage => sub {
        my ($self, $message, $channel, $pattern) = @_;
      });

    Emitted when a $message is received on a $channel matching a $pattern,
    after it has been subscribed to.

ATTRIBUTES
  encoding
      $str = $self->encoding;
      $self = $self->encoding('UTF-8');

    Holds the encoding using for data from/to Redis. Default is UTF-8.

  protocol
      $obj = $self->protocol;
      $self = $self->protocol($obj);

    Holds an object used to parse/generate Redis messages. Defaults to
    Protocol::Redis::XS or Protocol::Redis.

    Protocol::Redis::XS need to be installed manually.

  url
      $url = $self->url;

    Holds a Mojo::URL object with the location to the Redis server. Default
    is "MOJO_REDIS_URL" or "redis://localhost:6379". The "url" need to be
    set in constructor. Examples:

      Mojo::Redis2->new(url => "redis://x:$auth_key\@$server:$port/$database_index");
      Mojo::Redis2->new(url => "redis://10.0.0.42:6379");
      Mojo::Redis2->new(url => "redis://10.0.0.42:6379/1");
      Mojo::Redis2->new(url => "redis://x:s3cret\@10.0.0.42:6379/1");

    In addition to the methods listed in this module, you can call these
    Redis methods on $self:

    append, echo, decr, decrby, del, exists, expire, expireat, get, getbit,
    getrange, getset, hdel, hexists, hget, hgetall, hincrby, hkeys, hlen,
    hmget, hmset, hset, hsetnx, hvals, incr, incrby, keys, lindex, linsert,
    llen, lpop, lpush, lpushx, lrange, lrem, lset, ltrim, mget, move, mset,

    zrem, zremrangebyrank, zremrangebyscore, zrevrange, zrevrangebyscore,
    zrevrank, zscore and zunionstore.

    See <http://redis.io/commands> for details.

  new
      $self = Mojo::Redis2->new(...);

    Object constructor. Makes sure "url" is an object.

  blpop
      $self = $self->blpop(@keys, $timeout, sub { my ($self, $res) = @_; });

    This method will issue the BLPOP command on the Redis server, but in its
    own connection. This means that $self can still be used to run other
    commands instead of being blocking.

    Note: This method will only work in a non-blocking environment.

    See also <http://redis.io/commands/blpop>.

  brpoplpush
      $self = $self->brpoplpush($from => $to, $timeout, sub { my ($self, $res) = @_; });

    Follows the same API as "blpop". See also
    <http://redis.io/commands/brpoplpush>.

  brpop
      $self = $self->brpop(@keys, $timeout, sub { my ($self, $res) = @_; });

    Follows the same API as "blpop". See also
    <http://redis.io/commands/brpop>.

  bulk
      $obj = $self->bulk;

    Returns a Mojo::Redis2::Bulk object which can be used to group Redis
    operations.

  client
      $self->client->$method(@args);

    Run "CLIENT" commands using Mojo::Redis2::Client.

  multi
      $txn = $self->multi;

    This method does not perform the "MULTI" Redis command, but returns a
    Mojo::Redis2::Transaction object instead.

    The Mojo::Redis2::Transaction object is a subclass of Mojo::Redis2,
    which will run all the Redis commands inside a transaction.

  psubscribe
      $self = $self->psubscribe(@patterns, sub { my ($self, $err, $res) = @_; ... });

    Used to subscribe to channels that match @patterns. Messages arriving
    over a matching channel name will result in "pmessage" events.

    See <http://redis.io/topics/pubsub> for details.

  subscribe
      $self = $self->subscribe(@channels, sub { my ($self, $err, $res) = @_; ... });

    Used to subscribe to @channels. Messages arriving over a channel will
    result in "message" events.

    See <http://redis.io/topics/pubsub> for details.
